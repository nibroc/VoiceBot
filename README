VoiceBot...

A crappy little bot that just voices people who PM it "voiceme"

Ops in the  channel it idles in can message "blockvoice user1 user2..." to
have the bot ignore "voiceme" PMs from those users.  (unblockvoice does the 
inverse)

Additionally, ops can PM it "RAW blah" and <blah> will be sent to back to the
server from the bot (example: "RAW MODE #chan -v nick")

Also, it has very basic !learn functionality

!learn test blah
? test
Will output blah


To run it:

python voicebot.py

Or to have it output debugging data to stdout:

python voicebot.py output
